The runnable applications should be in the Releases tab for downloading.
Discord Webhook Controller lets you control Discord webhooks to say whatever you want!
All you need to do to set this up is the Webhook URL of the webhook you want to send messages through.

### How to Use
1. Paste the your webhook URL, which can be found by clicking "Copy Webhook URL" in the Discord App, into `config.ini`. The config file can be editted by any simple text editor, including Notepad (default Windows editor), TextEdit (default MacOS editor).
2. Save the config file, the run the program.
3. Type and enter any messages you want to be sent from the webhook into the console.
